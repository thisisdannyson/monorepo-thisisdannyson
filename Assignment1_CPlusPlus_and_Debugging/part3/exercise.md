Debugging

Edit the following lines to list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" exercise, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging.

1. looking at the stacktrace is super useful to see the origin of where the bug was called when going through layers of abstraction
2. while using the debugger in vscode, I found it very helpful to know the current values of each piece of data as it goes through the debugger (current iteration, objects, etc...)
